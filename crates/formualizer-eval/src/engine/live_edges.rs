//! Live-edge collection for statically-cyclic SCC evaluation (Stage 1 of the
//! runtime-cycle-verdicts work; pre-work for RFC #112).
//!
//! When a statically-cyclic SCC is evaluated member-by-member (Stage 2), we
//! must record which reads *actually occurred* targeting other SCC members
//! ("live edges"). Untaken short-circuit branches (`IF`/`IFS`/`CHOOSE`/
//! `SWITCH`, ...) never execute their reads, so they contribute no live edges
//! for free. After a pass, Stage 2 classifies the live subgraph: acyclic means
//! the cycle was phantom (values stand); cyclic means `#CIRC!` or iterative
//! evaluation.
//!
//! Stage 1 ships only the collection machinery:
//!
//! * [`LiveEdgeCollector`] — a per-SCC set of member cells plus the live edges
//!   observed so far.
//! * [`RecordingContext`] — a delegating [`EvaluationContext`] wrapper around
//!   `&Engine<R>` that records reads as they resolve and forwards everything
//!   else verbatim.
//!
//! # Inertness (binding constraint)
//!
//! Nothing in this module is wired into any production evaluation path. The
//! acyclic/hot evaluation path never constructs a `RecordingContext`; no
//! `Engine` field, flag, or branch was added. The wrapper is only exercised by
//! Stage-2 SCC tasks (future) and by tests, so its cost is strictly zero for
//! ordinary recalculation.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! SCC members are evaluated **sequentially on a single thread**; the
//! collector is never contended. Interior mutability is required because the
//! resolver traits take `&self`, and the `Send + Sync` super-bounds on
//! [`crate::traits::ReferenceResolver`] et al. rule out `RefCell`, so we use a
//! `Mutex`. It is uncontended by construction (single-threaded SCC pass), so
//! the lock is a fast path (uncontested futex acquire) and never blocks.
//!
//! # Coordinates
//!
//! The collector API uses the engine's internal convention: 0-based row and
//! column indices, rectangles **inclusive** of both corners (matching
//! [`RangeView::start_row`]/[`RangeView::end_row`] and `CellRef`'s `Coord`).
//! Resolver-level call sites (1-based Excel coordinates) convert before
//! recording.
